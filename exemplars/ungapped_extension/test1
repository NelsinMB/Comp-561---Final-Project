###
This is a nice example as it extends a seed CT to HSP CTA, barely. The expected score of adding 'A' is 0.00, which is due to an even match/mismatch score and 'A' occurring in D with probability 0.5. Any lower probability would have yielded 'CT' as the output. 
Not proven: In cases where the magnitude of the match score and the mismatch score are equal, the expected score is negative when P(max_nucleotide) < 0.5, positive when P(max_nucleotide) > 0.5.
